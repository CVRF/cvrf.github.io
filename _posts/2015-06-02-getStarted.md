# Get Started
 Learn about how to get started with CVRF and how to use it. The following are some resources to get you started with CVRF:

## CVRF is a Language
It is a structured way for one machine to communicate with another machine about a topic their human operators find very interesting: information system vulnerabilities. CVRF was built using XML: XML is a meta-language – it doesn't actually do anything. CVRF doesn't actually do anything, either. It is a static framework used to structure, store, and transport information. CVRF is merely a structured container for information about information system vulnerabilities. How that information is ultimately transported, parsed, or used is completely up to its users.

CVRF documents must contain several mandatory, root-level elements. This is done to ensure a solid and consistent foundation upon which to construct documents. The following are the required elements:

The Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) Dictionary of Elements is the definitive reference for the CVRF language, version 1.1.This is a living document managed by the Internet Consortium for Advancement of Security on the Internet (ICASI). It should be maintained and kept current with the CVRF Mindmap and CVRF Schema documents of the same version. Please note that CVRF 1.1 is not backward compatible with 1.0.

The following dictionary is grouped by schema, but is not derivative documentation from the schema documents themselves. The information contained here is more descriptive and complete.
